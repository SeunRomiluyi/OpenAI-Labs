Sunscreen: It's important to protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays, especially when spending a day outdoors. Look for a sunscreen with a high SPF and water-resistant formula.\n\n2. Swimsuit: You'll definitely want to wear a swimsuit to enjoy all the water rides and attractions at Schlitterbahn. Choose a comfortable and secure swimsuit that you feel confident in.\n\n3. Water shoes: The ground around the water park can get hot and slippery, so it's a good idea to wear water shoes to protect your feet and provide better traction.\n\n4. Towel: Bring a towel to dry off after getting wet on the rides or to lay on when taking a break.\n\n5. Water bottle: Staying hydrated is important, so bring a refillable water bottle to keep with you throughout the day.\n\n6.
