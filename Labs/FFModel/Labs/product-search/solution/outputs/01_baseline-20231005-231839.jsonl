Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. Swimsuit: Make sure you have a comfortable swimsuit that fits well and stays in place while you're riding the water slides.\n\n2. Sunscreen: Protect your skin from the sun's harmful rays with a high SPF sunscreen. Apply it liberally and frequently throughout the day.\n\n3. Water shoes: The pavement around the park can get hot, so water shoes will protect your feet and provide better traction on slippery surfaces.\n\n4. Towel: Bring a towel to dry off after rides and to sit on while you're taking a break.\n\n5. Waterproof phone case: If you want to take photos or videos while you're at the park, a waterproof phone case will protect your phone from water damage.\n\n6. Snacks and water: Staying hydrated and fueled up is important, so bring plenty of water and snacks to keep you going throughout the day.\n\n7. Cash or credit card: You'll need money for food, drinks, and any souvenirs you want to buy, so make sure you have cash or a credit card with you."]}, "log": {}, "error": null}
