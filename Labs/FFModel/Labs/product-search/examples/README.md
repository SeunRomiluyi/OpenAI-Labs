# Examples

This folder contains example experiments to get you started with FFModel. The nl2kql and nl2sql experiments aim to generate KQL and SQL code from natural language prompts, respectively.

To run a local experiment, use [nl2kql](../examples/nl2kql/). For a cloud-based experiment, use [nl2sql](../examples/nl2sql/). The notebooks can be run by starting up a Jupyter Notebook session in a kernal that has FFModel installed,from the terminal by executing `jupyter-notebook`. More information on getting started with Jupyter Notebooks can be found [here](https://jupyter.org).
