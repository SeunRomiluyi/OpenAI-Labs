    "# Creating a simple chatbot using the ChatGPT model\n",
    "This sample notebook demonstrates  creation of a simple chatbot that uses the ChatGPT model using the Chat Completion API.  The API takes in an array of messages that have the following parts:\n",
    "- role (system - sets the overall behavior for the assistant , user - provides specific instructions for the assistant, assistant - stores previous responses and can be used for fine tuning to achieve desired behavior)\n",
    "- content\n",
    "\n",
    "For this lab the system message will be a simple description, and the messages sent to the api will be only the user's last prompt.  \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\">\n",
    "<b>Note:</b> Because the model has no memory, while interacting with the chatbot, there will be no context/history based on any prior messages, each message is treated like a brand new conversation.</div>\n"
