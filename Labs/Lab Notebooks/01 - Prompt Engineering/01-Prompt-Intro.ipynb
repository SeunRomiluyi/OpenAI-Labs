    "**Temperature** - controls randomness (or creativity), value between 0 and 1, it does this by affecting the probability distribution over the possible tokens at the generation step - a setting of 0 is deterministic, the higher the number the more \"creative\" the response.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top_p** - Reduces the set of considered tokens to the top percentage, also value between 0 and 1, a setting of 0.1 will consider only the top 10% of the probability mass for the next token.\n",
